# Agentic AI Homework - Gemini Translator Agent

This repository contains the homework project for creating an autonomous translation agent using the Gemini API.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how to build a professional translation agent using the Gemini API, wrapped with an OpenAI-style client. The agent translates any input text into a target language specified by the user, maintaining the original tone and accuracy.

## Features

- Uses Gemini API (`gemini-2.0-flash` model) for natural language translation
- Async OpenAI-compatible client for API interaction
- Custom agent instructions to handle translation requests
- Example code to run synchronous translation requests

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kiranMushtaque/agentic-ai-1-class.git
   cd agentic-ai-1-class
